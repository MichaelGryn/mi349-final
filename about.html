            <div class="about-text">
                <p>I'm currently a junior Computer Science student at Michigan State University, deeply interested in Frontend Development and 
                    Software Engineering. My passion for technology began when I sat in front of a computer for the first time in elementary school. 
                    Over the years, I've watched technology evolve, particularly the rapid development of smartphones, and it's this constant 
                    innovation that drives my curiosity and enthusiasm for the field.</p>
                    
                <p>I have been interested in computers and technology ever  since I sat in front of one in elementary school. 
                    I lived through the development of smart phones while using my dad's old BlackBerry for some time. I am fascinated 
                    by just how quickly this technology has morphed and  changed itself to become more efficient and utilized by 
                    everyone all across the globe.</p>
        
                <p>Outside of my studies, I'm passionate about maintaining a healthy balance between work and personal life. I enjoy spending time with 
                    friends, working out at the gym, and watching football on Sundays. My goal is to combine my technical skills with my creativity to 
                    contribute to innovative solutions in the tech industry.</p>
